# cryptotracker
Cryptocurrency price dashboard made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Uses async/await to interact with an API and return cryptocurrency data. Depending on which cryptocurrency you are searching for, it may not return all categories of the data listed because the API doesn't store each listed category for every currency.
